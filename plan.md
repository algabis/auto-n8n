# n8n MCP Server Development Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development plan for a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that integrates with self-hosted n8n instances through the n8n REST API. The MCP server will enable AI assistants to manage workflows, execute debugging operations, and provide comprehensive workflow analytics through standardized MCP tools and resources.

## Project Overview

### Vision
Create a powerful MCP server that bridges AI assistants with n8n workflow automation, enabling natural language workflow management, intelligent debugging, and proactive workflow optimization.

### Core Objectives
1. **Workflow Management**: Create, read, update, delete, and execute n8n workflows programmatically
2. **Intelligent Debugging**: Provide advanced debugging capabilities with execution analysis and error resolution
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor workflow executions, performance metrics, and system health
4. **AI-Driven Insights**: Generate workflow optimization suggestions and performance analytics
5. **Secure Integration**: Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms

## Important API Limitations

⚠️ **Key Limitation**: The n8n API **does not provide direct workflow execution**. Workflows can only be executed through:
- Webhook triggers
- Schedule triggers  
- Manual execution in the n8n UI
- External triggers configured in the workflow

This affects the MCP server design - we can manage workflows but cannot directly execute them via API.

## Market Analysis & Use Cases
